# Consommation

## 1. Intro

#### Problème du consommateur:
```
Nous allons analyser le problème fondamental d'un consommateur, 
qui est de décider comment dépenser une somme d'argent. 
```

#### Prédiction
```
En se bassant sur notre modèle du consommateur, nous allons 
déterminer comment des changements dans l'environnement économique
du consommateur affecteront ses décisions
```

### 1.2 Modélisation

The consumers problem is complex: There are plenty of things a consumer can spend his money.
On top of that, they can save or invest. If try to analyse the problem aas a whole in all it`s
complexity, we will get lost. 

Like in all sciences, the economists explains things with models. A **Model** is a simplified version of reality,
but where we can still pull conclusions from which can be applied in real life. 

In the first chapter, we want to reduce the consumer`s problem to it`s simplest state. 
We will therefore assume that:

- The individual has a sum **R**
- He has to spend it entirely on 2 goods
- The 2 Price of the 2 goods are fix and knows

Despite the simplifiations, we will obtain the results that will let us better understand real economy. 

### 1.3 Subjectivité

Two diferent consumers will generally spend the same sum of money in 2 diferent ways. 
It`s because their decision depends on their **preference** (i.e. their taste).  It this sense, the consumer's problem is a subjective problem. But this does not stop us from analysing; and out analysis will not remove anything from this subjectivity.

## 2 Le problème du consommateur

the consumer's problem is to distribute a budget **R** between two different consumer goods. Specifically, he has to choose:

- **x**: the quantity of the first goods
- **y**: the quantity of the second goods

He has to make his choice based on the following parameters:

- **R**: his budget (measured in $)
- **p_x**: price of first good (measured in $/unit)
- **p_y**: price of second good (measured in $/unit)

The entire budget must be spent on the 2 goods: there is no possibility of saving. We will return to the question of saving later on, because for sure, it is an important subject; but essentially we can argue that we can treat saving like another "consommation"


Ex: take a 20$ gift card for a resto where each slice of cake costs 4$ + each cup of coffee = 2$
- rest of the menu doesn't interest us so there are only these 2 goods.
- The gift card expires midnight, so you must spend everything right away.

- **x** : le nombre de morceau de gateau
- **y** : le nombre de tasses de cafe

- The parameters of the problem are: **R = 20, p_x = 4, p_y = 2**

- These parameters impose limits to what you can consume. You can choose one of the following combinations of cake and coffee.

#### Tableau 1 

| | nb of slice of cake (x) | nb of cups of coffee (y) | amount spent in cake (p_xx) | amount spent in coffee (p_y_y) |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Combination 1 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 20 |
| Combination 2 | 1 | 8 | 4 | 16 |
| Combination 3 | 2 | 6 | 8 | 12 |
| Combination 4 | 3 | 4 | 12 | 8 | 
| Combination 5 | 4 | 2 | 16 | 4 |
| Combination 6 | 5 | 0 | 20 | 0 |

Notice that all combination satisfies the linear equation:

**4x + 2y = 20**

Here the **4x** is the sum spent in cake:the number of pieces (**x**) multiplied by the prize (**$4** per piece). Similarly **2y** is the sum spent in coffee. A more general way is (i.e. allowing different values for the parameters) 

**p_xx +p_yy = R**

- This equation is called ** contrainte budgetaire**. It's the equation that we need to satisfy to balance a budget.
- This equation can be represented on a graph:

![Figure 1](https://github.com/JanVillapaz/ECO1081_AUT2020/blob/master/Consommation/fig1.PNG?raw=true).

Each point on the graph is represents one of the possible combinations. The consumers problem comes down to choosing a point on the "contrainte budgétaire". Calling the point chosen (**x***,**y***). This represents the **quantité demandée** of each goods. 

**x*** = Required quantity of good **x** (cake)
**y*** = Required quantity of good **y** (coffee)

![Figure 2](https://github.com/JanVillapaz/ECO1081_AUT2020/blob/master/Consommation/fig2.PNG?raw=true).

Think of what you'll choose in these circomstances. Then ask another person qhat she chooses. The choices might be different. One thing is certain: the optimal choice for one person might not neessarily be optimal for the other. The optimal choice depends on the person's "taste" in regards to the 2 goods in question.

Is it possible to represent a persons taste graphicly or algebraicly? YES! In economy we use **courbes d'indifférence** t represent an individuals preferences graphicly, and a **fonction d'utilité** to represent algebraicly. (Talked about at the end of the chapter).

```
En ´economie on utilise davantage le mot pr´ef´erences que le mot goˆuts. Le mot pr´ef´erences est
un peu plus math´ematique, car le verbe pr´ef´erer exprime une relation binaire entre objets: on peut
pr´ef´erer l’option A `a l’option B, ou encore classer plusieurs choses en ordre de pr´ef´erence.
```
More generally, the contraint budgetaire looks like this : 

![Figure 3](https://github.com/JanVillapaz/ECO1081_AUT2020/blob/master/Consommation/fig3.PNG?raw=true).

Notice the right slope. This is always negative, so we don't necessarily specify the negative sign. The important is the slopes value. This expresses the **prix relatif** of the 2 goods.

Prix relatif = |pente| = p_x / p_y
